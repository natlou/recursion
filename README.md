# recursion
1. What is the simpliest possible input? (base case) 
2. Play around with examples and visualize.
3. Relating hard cases to simpler cases (large cases to smaller cases AKA induction).
4. Generalize the pattern i.e inductive step so define f(N + 1) in terms of N and f(N). 
5. Write code by combining recursive pattern with base case. 

pseudocode 
function recursive_fn(n):
  if (base_case): 
    return base
  else: 
    return recursive_fn(n - 1);
