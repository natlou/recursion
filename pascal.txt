Each row in Pascal’s triangle starts with a 1
1
, and ends with a 1
1
, hence line is initialized with [1] and later 1
1
 is pushed in line variable (line number 8 and 16).

Also, each row is calculated based on the values of the previous row. Thus, the function makes a recursive function call with the previous row number as its argument, i.e., testVariable - 1.

If we reach 0th
0th
 row, we return a list containing only 1
1
 value: [1]
[1]
. This is our base case.

Now, for each recursive call, we use the values of the previous solution.

Let’s have a look at the sequence of function calls:
