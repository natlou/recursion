Problem Statement#
Imagine you have been given the task to schedule some tasks. The tasks are represented as vertices of the graph, and if a task u
must be completed before a task v can be started, then there is an edge from u to v in the graph.

Find the order of the tasks so that each task can be performed in the right order.

This problem can be solved if we find the topological sorting of the graph.
